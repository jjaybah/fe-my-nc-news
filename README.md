# Northcoders News Front End

I built this project during my JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders. It is based on the API I created earlier.

The front end is built with React and showcases:

- Planning and implementing a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective
- Mobile-first design approach, ensuring responsiveness for desktop and mobile users
- Displaying data reactively based on user actions with dynamic rendering of article and comment data
- Reusable components, use of `useContext`, and React Router for state management and navigation
- Thoughtful user experience with loading states, error handling, and optimistic rendering
- Focus on accessibility and user-centric design

Check out the live version of the app here: [Northcoders News](https://yb-nc-news.netlify.app)

You can find the backend repository here: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/jjaybah/my-nc-news)
